export const AboutUsDiscText = `In recent years, the shift from print to digital has impacted how we learn. What printing press was for mass awareness six centuries ago, digital technology is today for transforming formal education and increasing learning opportunities. Digital learning is not only allowing students to access more information but also ensuring that the information is customizable and suited to their personal needs.
Gyanodaya Godda, an education initiative has been successfully instituted by Godda District Administration, Adani Foundation and Eckovation in the Godda District of Jharkhand, India. The learning process used in the Model involves audio-visual classrooms having animated and contextualized lectures followed by daily assessments.  The first interaction with the students happens in the classroom, where they watch the video screencast on the television. The videos are kept super interactive which ensures a good level attentiveness from the students.
The use of Artificial Intelligence for personalized feedbacks of the learning outcomes has made this model look completely different. The Gyanodaya Model has structured its process in such a way that it gives the students and their teachers personalized feedback comparing the baseline of 30,000 students with the impact of Gyanodaya. This makes classroom teaching more interactive with the use of digital methods such as PPTs, video presentations, practical demos, online training, and other digital platforms.
The adoption of Virtual Reality Technology has given Gyanodaya a cutting-edge over the rising attempts of bringing Sci-Fi in education. It has enabled the students to get a better explanation of academic subjects like geography, chemistry, physics, etc. Bringing the gamification factor in academics has made education more exciting. 
Multiple benefits of digital learning have been observed in the transformation of around 70,000 children such as - digital skills, decision making capabilities, visual learning, cultural awareness, improved academic performance and inventiveness. The visually appealing, easy-to-grasp and retainable concepts covered in the study materials has led to a 77% increase in the class-wise attendance comparing the figures of past years.
After a year into the program, the majority of schools struggling with about 20-30% attendance before the introduction of Gyanodaya were able to improve to above 50% after the advent of Gyanodaya. A major breakthrough has also been observed in the passing percentage of class 10th students.
With the limited resources available, Gyanodaya’s digital learning provides an effective way to cut costs, maximize resources and heighten both reach and impact for students and educators alike. Gyanodaya believes that the students are at the center of any learning process and the highlight of the project lies in its social outreach. Children belonging to the families of farmers, daily wage laborers, craftsmen, etc. stand to be the main beneficiaries. In a short span of 15 months, the outreach of Gyanodaya has been well received by more than 600 schools where more than 70,000 students are enrolled across the district, a number only increasing by a good margin every month, substantiating its commendable performance and enthusiastic reception. `;
